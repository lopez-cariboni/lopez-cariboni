 abstract = {Here I discuss the idea that irregular access to electricity can be understood as a program of informal social transfers to provide insurance in volatile, developing countries. I analyze the expected consequences of democratization for the provision of irregular electricity. In democracies from developing countries, incumbents are challenged with the need to provide insurance given the highly volatile contexts in which they rule, and the absence of consumption-smoothing mechanisms to protect the population against recurrent negative shocks. I show descriptive evidence that transmissions and distribution (T & D) losses of electricity are counter-cyclical in democratic countries but are not in autocracies.},
